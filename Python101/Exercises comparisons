##Create a program that will ask for a username and then a password.
##If the username or password length is less than 6 charecters give a too short message.
if the username or password length is greater than 12 charecters give a too long message
Have the user confirm the password in again.
If the passwords match give a sucess message
if the passwords do not match give a mismatch message
If the password is only numbers give a message that says it cannot be a number.
(challange) have only one print statement in the whole program. 

user_greet = '\nPlease enter username:\n'
pass_greet1 = '\nPlease enter password:\n'
pass_greet2 = '\nPlease confirm password:\n'


user_input = input(user_greet)
if not user_input
    print('You must enter a password')
else:
    if len(user_input) < 6 or len(user_input > 12)
    print('Username must be between 6-12 characters.')

pass_input = input(pass_greet1)
if len(pass_input) > 12 or lent(pass_input < 6)
    print('Password must be between 6-12 characters.')
else:
    print(pass_greet2)

pass_input2 = input(pass_greet2)
if pass_input != pass_input2
    print('Passwords must match')
    else: 
        if pass_input == pass_input2
        print('Success! Your passwords match.')
